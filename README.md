# AirQualityIndex-

The system that I proposed is Air Quality Index (AQI) System. AQI system is a tool for tracking the state of the air in a certain area or place in Malaysia. The AQI system monitors the amount of several air pollutants, such as carbon monoxide, ozone, sulphur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide in the atmosphere. It also gives these concentrations a numerical number to represent the air quality and any resulting health impacts. 
 
In most cases, the AQI runs from 0 to 500, with more numbers of denoting poorer air quality. For sensitive populations, such as those with heart or respiratory diseases, numbers exceeding 100 are regarded as harmful. Good air quality is defined as having a score of 50 or below. A major health risk to the general populace can result from AQI readings exceeding 300, which are regarded as dangerous. 
 
Usually, government organisations and environmental groups utilise the AQI system to inform the public about the conditions of air quality in their neighbourhood and to send out notifications when air quality levels reach dangerous levels. With this system, this knowledge can assist people in making decisions regarding their outside activities and protecting their health by remaining indoors and avoiding intense activity, for instance. 
 
Air Quality Index (AQI) System is implemented by coding. The programming languages used to develop this system are front-end which are HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
